            Top diplomats from the US and China will meet in person on Thursday for the first high-level talks between the two countries since President Joe Biden took office.
          </p>
        </div>
          <p>
            Beijing is aiming to reset ties after years of tension. Washington says the meeting is a one-off and future engagements depend on "deeds, not words".
          </p>
          <p>
            The dialogue will help indicate how hard the Biden administration is willing to push China on a range of issues.

            We asked young people in the US and in China about the future of US-China relations.
          </p>
          <p>
            Here's what three Americans and three Chinese nationals told us:
          </p>
          <img class=interviewee src="images/peyton-forte.png" alt="Peyton Forte"src>
          <p>
            Peyton is a young black progressive who does not view China as a foe and says the two countries should work together 
            on climate change.
          </p>
          <div class="interviewer">
            <p>
              Do you view China as an adversary or a potential partner?
            </p>
          </div>
            <p>
              The US government 100% considers China to be an adversary at this point. Any country that threatens the US's 
              place as the greatest economic power in the world would be seen as an enemy. Add in the ideological differences, 
              spying [and] hacking allegations, and general AAPI [Asian American and Pacific Islander] discrimination, and I
              wouldn't be surprised if the majority of Americans feel the same way.
            </p>
            <p>
              I personally have no strong feelings toward China either way. I don't think the country or any of its citizens 
              have done anything of significance for me to make that determination.
            </p>
          <div class="interviewer">
            <p>
              What do you think the two countries could work together on?
            </p>
          </div>
            <p>
              I'd like to see the US and China, along with other nations, commit to decarbonisation and the development of 
              renewable energy standards to address climate change, as well as tackling this pandemic and preparing for any 
              future ones. I'm not too worried about joint trade deals or the global economy because I think other issues are 
              more pressing.
            </p>
          <div class="interviewer">
            <p>
              Is there anything about China you admire that the US doesn't have?
            </p>
          </div>
            <p>
              I actually took a Chinese class for five years and was a part of the Confucius Institute at my high school. I 
              admire China's much more sensible gun policies and how most of its government spending is directed toward education 
              [and] social welfare rather than its military.
            </p>
            <p>
              If the US was as inclined to invest money into its citizens rather than building a [military], the country probably 
              wouldn't lag so far behind in global childhood education rankings.
            </p>
          <img class=interviewee src="images/zeng-jiajun.png" alt="Zeng Jiajun"src>
            <p>
              Jiajun quit his job as product manager of a leading Chinese tech company last year and has enrolled in a computer science
              graduate program in the US this autumn.

          <div class="interviewer">

              Do you view the US as an adversary or a potential partner?
            </p>
          </div>
            <p>
              I think, no matter in the short or long term, America is China's partner. China has imported many technologies from the US. 
              Even though China's home-grown innovation is now on the rise, many leading Chinese tech companies still look up to their
              American peers in Silicon Valley. For Chinese companies aiming to expand to markets outside China, stable trade and economic 
              ties with the US are of the utmost importance.
            </p>

          </div>
            <p>
              Energy and environmental issues. The planet needs to become more sustainable, and the joint efforts of China and America are 
              absolutely essential.
            </p>
          <div class="interviewer">
            <p>
              Is there anything about the US you admire that China doesn't have?
            </p>
          </div>
            <p>
              America's political system is very resilient and can correct itself. [Former US President Donald] Trump's four years were like 
              a stress test to America, and it has survived. The recent civil rights movement also shows America is a society that continues 
              to reflect on and improve itself.
            </p>
            <p>
              On a more personal level, the US offers better work-life balance, while jobs in the Chinese tech industry are extremely stressful 
              and demanding.
            </p>
          <img class=interviewee src="images/gabrielle-kalisz.png" alt="Gabrielle Kalisz"src>
            <p>
              Gabrielle, a Republican who voted for Joe Biden in the 2020 election, is extremely wary of the threat China poses to the US and 
              the rest of the world.
            </p>
          <div class="interviewer">
            <p>
              Do you view China as an adversary or a potential partner?
            </p>
          </div>
            <p>
              I strongly believe that China is our adversary. The United States has no place creating international partnerships or friendships 
              that turn a blind eye to a communist regime that has committed multiple human rights atrocities, broken their independence agreement
              with Hong Kong, escalated tensions repeatedly in the South China Sea, and covered up and perpetuated a global pandemic for the sake 
              of minimising political fallout.
            </p>
            <p>
              China does not view the United States with any sort of respect and they should not be given any in return.
            </p>
          <div class="interviewer">
            <p>
              What do you think the two countries could work together on?
            </p>
          </div>
            <p>
              While I am immensely sceptical of any future partnership with China, it is in the best interest of both the United States and China 
              to [work on] denuclearisation in certain regions of the world. Nuclear weapons in the hands of the wrong parties are not only a threat 
              to the United States but to the entire world.
            </p>
            <p>
              Nuclear programmes in nations such as North Korea perpetuate regional instability. Both the United States and China must agree to not 
              supply nuclear components to these regimes. China must agree to this mutual goal or risk further worsening relations with the United States.
            </p>
          <div class="interviewer">
            <p>
              Is there anything about China you admire that the US doesn't have?
            </p>
          </div>
            <p>
              The Chinese and Taiwanese people have a tremendous drive for freedom and opportunity, and the world will be better off when they can pursue 
              that end to its fullest potential.
            </p>
            <p>
              While the government is disgraceful and does not deserve any admiration, the people that live under China's oppressive regime should be 
              respected for their perseverance. The will and determination of the Chinese people is entirely commendable and I look forward to the day they 
              will not have to live under such an inhumane and oppressive regime.

              Adversary. The negative public opinion both countries hold towards each other has reached a turning point and there's no way back. It's often said 
              that China-US relations are like a marriage. It seems to me that this marriage cannot be saved anymore.

          </div>
            <p>
              Like a divorced couple who will still take care of their children together, China and the US have shared interests, when it comes to global issues 
              like the pandemic and climate.

            </p>
          </div>
            <p>
              Probably not. Shanghai and San Francisco have a lot in common, offering a variety of cultures and goods. As a country, America is probably more 
              multicultural than China and there is less pressure to conform.
            </p>

            <p>
              Gabriel is very active in New York Young Republican circles and he says neither the Biden administration nor the US media pushes for Chinese 
              accountability as much as they should.

          </div>
            <p>
              I see the Chinese Communist government as a threat. They're rebuilding their military and creating islands in the South China Sea where they 
              claim they're able to "deploy military assets, including combat aircraft and mobile missile launchers to the Spratly Islands at any time". 
              The Chinese government is also becoming more expansionist with Taiwan and its neighbours. That behaviour is unacceptable.

          </div>
            <p>
              I believe the US and China should work more on creating an exit strategy with our corporations. It's shameful that American 
              companies exploit the Chinese as a means to produce their products. We need to ensure jobs come back to our workers in this 
              time of economic recovery.

          </div>
            <p>
              What I admire about China is their ability to get away with their actions. It's astounding, the Biden administration covers for 
              their genocide of the Uighurs and bigotry. So does the majority of American media. They have consistent human rights violations 
              with their forced labour practices, general mistreatment of their population, invasion of privacy with their social credit system, 
              and lied about Covid.

            <p>
              I think America is more a potential partner than an adversary to China. I can't speak for all Chinese people, but I personally 
              believe China has learned a great deal from America. My current view is based on the premise that America is not being very hostile to 
              China. If you had asked me during the Trump era, I may have given a different answer.

            <p>
              America and China can work together on humanity's great existential crises, such as climate change. If the two largest countries in terms 
              of energy consumption can work together, it would be crucial for our future. In other aspects where the two countries have significant disagreements, 
              I hope to see co-operation as well, but I don't think it's realistic.

            <p>
              Cultural diversity. I think multiculturalism is America's greatest advantage. It is a melting pot where you can find many cultures from other parts of the 
              world. In comparison, China is more homogenous. But I am concerned that the Trump era has severely damaged the openness of America.
